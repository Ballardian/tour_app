Probiotics help maintain 'friendly' bacteria in the digestive tract which can be useful in fighting against 'unfriendly' bacteria - the bacteria which can cause the dreaded Delhi belly, yeast infections or diarrhea.</small></p></li>

            <li><p><small>It is also recommended to use bottled water for brushing your teeth with. </small></p></li>
            <li><p><small>For a short trip to India its also best to avoid salad which has been rinsed and has water on it and ice cubes. Personally I eat salad and ice cubes but I have been here for a long time so my stomach has adapted.</small></p></li>
            <li><p><small>It's best to chose fruit which have skins which are easy to remove and non-edible - such as bananas, oranges, pineapples etc.</small></p></li>
            <li><p><small>Packing re-hyrdation sachets is highly recommended, they're great for replenishing fluids and electrolytes if you do feel slightly under the weather.</small></p></li>
