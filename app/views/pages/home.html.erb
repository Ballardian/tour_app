          <br>
          <p><small>Bhavana in the ancient Sanskrit language means to cultivate. I aim to create tours in which you feel safe and comfortable, so that you can absorb the magic of India. I hope that through experiencing India with me, it will broaden your horizons and cultivate your mind.</small></p>

          <h1 class="orange"><strong> WHY </strong></h1>
          <br>
          <p><small>Over the years, many people have been shocked by my confidence and even look up to me in awe. Some of the comments I often hear are: <br><br> "How do you do it?!" <br> "You're so brave!" <br> "I could never do what you do." <br><br> I want you to hear the same when you get home.</small></p>

          <h1 class="orange"><strong> HOW </strong></h1>
          <br>
          <p><small>Everything that you see on the itinerary is based on my own experiences, we'll be doing things which I have already done and loved. It's really important to me that I plan a trip that I would also enjoy. So I am not planning tour bus holidays where we will be jumping on and off a bus. We'll be trying to experience "the real India" as much as possible - that's why we will be traveling between our destinations by train. The class that we'll travel by is actually very similar to English trains but you'll notice how much more open the people are. Indians are very curious about foreign visitors and are eager to start friendly conversations.</small></p>
